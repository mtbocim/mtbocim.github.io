            <h2>A little about myself:</h2>
            <p class="about-me">
                I've been repairing musical instrument for nearly a decade, 
                and looking to move into the world of the web. 
                I've been dabbling in logic and coding since high school on my ti-83. 
                <br><br>
                Since then it has manifested in different places throughout my adulthood.
                My favorite bit of code I ever wrote was a program I wrote in college for a music theory class. 
                It used music rules to generate a text file which was 
                then read by a music notation program plugin I also wrote and transcribed into four distinct voices (I'm proud to say I recieved an A on that project). 
                <br><br>
                In my downtime, I'm 100% a hobbyist, occasional jazz performer, cad drawing to 3d printing creator, 
                pc and board gamer, origami folder, nature photographer.
                <br><br> 
                I think I just like patterns and structure, wherever that may surface, and strive to incorporate them into my life.
