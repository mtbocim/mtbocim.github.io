                <h3>A little about myself:</h3>
                <p class="long-text">
                    I've been repairing musical instrument for nearly a decade, 
                    and looking to move into the programming world. 
                    I've been dabbling in logic since high school on my ti-83. 
                    My favorite bit of code I ever wrote was a program I wrote in college. 
                    It used music rules to generate a text file which was 
                    then read by a music notation program and transcribed (I got an A on that project!). 
                    In my downtime, I'm 100% a hobbyist. 3d printing and cad drawing, 
                    pc and board gaming, origami, nature photography. 
                    Really, I think I just like patterns and structure, wherever that may surface.
