                <h3>A little about myself:</h3>
                <p>
                    I've been repairing musical instrument for nearly a decade, 
                    and looking to move into the programming world. 
                    I've been dabbling in logic and coding since high school on my ti-83. 
                    <br><br>
                    Since then it has manifested in different places throughout my adulthood.
                    My favorite bit of code I ever wrote was a program I wrote in college for a music theory class. 
                    It used music rules to generate a text file which was 
                    then read by a music notation program plugin I also wrote and transcribed into four distinct voices (I'm proud to say I recieved an A on that project). 
                    <br><br>
                    In my downtime, I'm 100% a hobbyist, occasional jazz performer, cad drawing to 3d printing creator, 
                    pc and board gamer, origami folder, nature photographer.
                    <br><br> 
                    I think I just like patterns and structure, wherever that may surface, and strive to incorporate them into my life.
