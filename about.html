                    I've been repairing musical instrument for nearly a decade, 
                    and involved in music in someway going even further back to when I was young.
                    Now I'm looking to move into the world of the web.

                    Puzzles and logic have always fascinated me.  I grew up with legos and Myst.  
                    Instead of doing my math homework, I tried to write programs in my ti-83 to do it for me.
                    Since then coding has manifested in various places throughout my adulthood.
                    My favorite bit of code I wrote to date was a music generating program for a music theory class. 
                    I'm proud to say I recieved an A on that project. 
                    <br><br>
                    I enjoy patterns and structure, wherever they may surface, and strive to incorporate them into my life.

                    In my downtime, I'm 100% a hobbyist, occasional jazz performer, cad drawing to 3d printing creator, 
                    pc and board gamer, origami folder, nature photographer.
